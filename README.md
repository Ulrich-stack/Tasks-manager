In this project I create a task management app with NextJS, TailwindCSS, MaterialUI, PostgreSQL.
The database is stocked on Vercel, where I deploy this app.

It is a ToDoApp. For now it had four pages, Tasks, Categories, Completed and Calendar.

Tasks is a basic todoApp. You can create, read, update, delete tasks. I can improve this page at the end of the other

In Categories i show all tasks pending by category. Here, you can change the category of a task by drag and drop and you can also delete
all tasks linked to a category.

I didn't start the other pages yet.

The app's visual can be highly improved.
