In this project I create a task management app with NextJS, TailwindCSS, MaterialUI, PostgreSQL.
The database is stocked on Vercel, where I deploy this app.

It is a ToDoApp. It has four pages, Tasks, Categories, Completed and Calendar.

In Categories i show all tasks pending by category. Here, you can change the category of a task by drag and drop and you can also delete
all tasks linked to a category.
